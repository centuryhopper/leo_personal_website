    'C#. I learned this language when I was learning to use the Unity Game engine to make video games. The language was easy to pick up because it was syntactically similar to Java, which I learned in high school and college.',
    'Python. This has become my favorite programming language. It reads like English and has many sweet syntactic sugars. I use it for leetcode, OpenCV, filehandling, and automating tasks via webscraping.',
    'JavaScript. I have learned this language through using Node.Js for building APIs for managing my own passwords, storing images in the cloud, and general storage purposes for any frontend applications I build.',
    'Dart. This is the language I use for flutter development. I love workflow and design of flutter for cross-platform mobile development. I have found this language very intuitive to learn because of its similarity to Java and JavaScript. Fun fact, this website was built using flutter web!',
    'C++. This is the language that had the highest learning curve for me so far. Luckily the C knowledge I acquired from college helped a lot because of pointers and memory address concepts, which most other modern languages lacked. I use this language mainly at my research position for building OpenCV projects which requires low-level control and processing performance-heavy tasks',
    'C, Java, Haskell, Erlang. These are mainly languages that I have used for university classes and have built me a solid foundation for learning other languages or frameworks in the software field.',
