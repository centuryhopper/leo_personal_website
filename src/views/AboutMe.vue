        Greetings! I am currently a Computer Science graduate student attending the
        University of Central Florida. My productive spare-time hobbies include
        full-stack development on web, mobile, and game applications. I am in
        graduate school because of an interest in AI. I am fascinated by how AI will
        shape the future of our society; as a result, I am trying to get a more
        in-depth understanding of the applications of AI. I currently work as a
        graduate research student at UCF. I am currently focusing my research efforts
        on building the software for an assistive robot using OpenCV in C++. With
        this experience, I have gained the skills needed incorporate such
        applications & concepts into my personal projects, and leverage such skills
        to contribute in the software idustry.
