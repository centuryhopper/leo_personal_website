There's a saying that with great power comes great responsibility and Arch Linux is no exception to that. It's taking me a while to get a lot done because there's so much work to be done with installing fonts, themes, and other packages. It is also very easy to break something in the system if you install an out of date package and uninstalling packages can be difficult too when there are other packages that depend of the current package to be deleted. The most difficult part of Arch Linux was installing it on my system. Luckily there is a built-in script called \"archinstall\" that eased the process of installation but I still found partitioning my disk to be a challenge as I chose auto-partition and accidentally wiped windows from my system.
